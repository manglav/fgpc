  "productOverview": "The Teradek VidiU is a consumer-grade on-camera video streaming device capable of sending 1080p HD video from a camera to the Web in real-time. You can be recording a kid's baseball game in the park and simultaneously broadcasting it to family at home. VidiU features an HDMI camera input and encodes video in the popular H.264 codec.\nVidiU streams to content delivery networks and media servers and is set up for native integration with the Ustream and Livestream platforms -- you'll just need to log in to one of these, select a channel or event, and stream. VidiU streams by dual-band WiFi and features a 60-minute internal battery to fully support wireless streaming, and it can also stream by Ethernet or by an optional 3G/4G USB modem.\nVidiU attaches right on top of a camera by an included hot shoe adapter. An OLED display indicates connection status and other info and is operable by joystick-type navigation buttons. Audio support includes AAC encoding and a headphone output. In addition to streaming to a platform, you can also simultaneously stream to an iOS device so you can monitor your live broadcast.",
